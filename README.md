# Finsemble .NET Seed

This is a seed project to help you get started building .NET Applications (currently only WPF is supported) to be used in [Finsemble](https://www.chartiq.com/finsemble/).

The seed contains a three sample projects
- AuthenticationExample: This shows how to use a .NET application as the authentication component in Finsemble
- WPFExample: This demonstrates using the Finsemble APIs for .NET apps and shows the WPF Window Title Bar user control which allows linking, drag and drop data sharing, and snapping and docking within Finsemble.
- WindowlessExample: This demonstrates using the Finsemble API for .NET without a displayed window which facilitates communications between Finsemble and (headless) native service components.
